# Visit [https://subnut.github.io/Goodtime-web](https://subnut.github.io/Goodtime-web)

This is a simple webpage intended to be a simpler desktop version of the [Goodtime](https://github.com/adrcotfas/Goodtime) Android app.  

I tried to make the upfront UI as similar as possible to the app, and also wanted to keep the webpage as light as possible, and also tried to keep the device screen awake while the timer is running.  
And I think I am eligible to say, I succeeded with flying colors. :partying_face:
  
  
  
###### Why _simple_ ?
Because I don't know JavaScript or CSS :slightly_smiling_face:  
All the JS and CSS of this page is written in a hurry by a **Python** coder!
  

###### Why is the code so ugly?
